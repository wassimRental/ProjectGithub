GitHub Tutorial: Uploading a Backend Project using Visual Studio
=============================================================================

This repository contains a step-by-step tutorial for uploading a project that includes a frontend application in Angular and a backend in .NET coupled, using Visual Studio and Git.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
----------------------------

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/back.git
Step 2: Prepare the Frontend Project
------------------------------------

Open the Angular project in your favorite code editor.

Configure the .gitignore file to ignore the frontend folder. Add the following line to the .gitignore file:

    # Ignore node_modules directory in frontend project
    frontend/node_modules/

    # Ignore other files or directories as needed

Step 3: Prepare the Backend Project
-----------------------------------

Open the .NET project in Visual Studio.

Ensure there are no unwanted files or folders that should be ignored. If necessary, adjust the .gitignore file to ignore them.

Step 4: Add Changes and Commit
------------------------------

Add the changes to the staging area using the `git add .` command.

Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

    git commit -m "Add frontend and backend projects"

Step 5: Push Changes to the Remote Repository
---------------------------------------------

Finally, push the changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command:

    git push origin main

You're all set! Now your frontend and backend projects are uploaded to GitHub.
